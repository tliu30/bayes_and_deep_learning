Some experiments to run to make sure I know what's going on

x. Make sure I know how torch autodifferentiation works
    x. First, fit a normal distribution using maximum likelihood
    x. Second, fit a multivariate normal distribution using maximum likelihood

x. Understand why the reparametrization trick helps
    x. Compute gradient estimates of parameter in distribution using
        x. the variational approximation
        x. the reparametrization

3. Implement GPLVM with MLE

4. Implement GPLVM with VB

5. Implement autoencoder

6. Implement vae-ish -- but optimized using MLE

7. Implement VAE
